## Conda environment using PowerShell 

When attempting to activate a Conda environment using PowerShell in Visual Studio Code and noticing it doesn't work as expected, there are a few common issues and solutions to consider. Here’s what you might need to check and how to address each possibility:

### 1. **Conda Initialization in PowerShell**

If Conda commands don’t work directly in PowerShell, it could be because Conda hasn’t been properly initialized for use with PowerShell. Conda needs to be initialized in each shell type you want to use it with.

To initialize Conda for PowerShell, you can run the following command in a PowerShell window that has administrative privileges:

```bash
conda init powershell
```

This command sets up the proper hooks for Conda in PowerShell, allowing the `conda` command and environments to be managed directly from within PowerShell.

### 2. **Conda Executable Not in Path**

If initialization doesn’t seem to be the issue, ensure that the path to the Conda executable is correctly included in your system's PATH environment variable. Sometimes, especially if you installed Anaconda or Miniconda for just the current user, it might not have updated the system PATH automatically.

You can check your PATH variable in PowerShell like this:

```powershell
$env:PATH
```

Look for a path that includes your Conda installation (typically something like `C:\Users\sanity\miniconda3\` or `C:\Users\sanity\Anaconda3\`). If it’s missing:

- Add it manually via System Properties > Environment Variables, or

- Use PowerShell to add it temporarily:

  ```powershell
  $env:PATH += ";C:\Users\sanity\miniconda3\"
  ```

  Replace `C:\Users\sanity\miniconda3\` with the path to your actual Conda installation.

### 3. **Restart Visual Studio Code**

After making changes like initializing Conda for PowerShell or updating environment variables, it’s a good idea to restart Visual Studio Code. This ensures that VS Code and its integrated terminal sessions pick up all the changes.

### 4. **Check Conda Environment Path**

Make sure that the Conda environment `tdm23_env_1` indeed exists. You can verify this by listing all available Conda environments:

```bash
conda env list
```

This will show all the environments and their paths, confirming whether `tdm23_env_1` is correctly installed and recognized.

### 5. **PowerShell Execution Policy**

Sometimes, PowerShell’s execution policy can prevent scripts from running, which might include some of Conda’s initialization scripts. To see your current execution policy, use:

```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```

If it’s set to `Restricted`, you might want to change it to `RemoteSigned` to allow locally created scripts to run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### 6. **Using Conda in PowerShell Script Mode**

In some cases, running `conda activate` directly in the script or command line interface mode in PowerShell might not work due to how Conda manages changes to the shell environment. Using:

```bash
conda activate
```

might require following it with an interactive script or opening a new PowerShell session.

By checking these areas, you should be able to resolve most issues with activating Conda environments in VS Code’s PowerShell terminal.
